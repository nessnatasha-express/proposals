                        As marketers implement platforms like Adobe's Marketo, using the right analytics tool is key to measuring success and gaining actionable insights across channels and customer journeys. The reality is that each tool has unique strengths. This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of the overall differences across channels and use cases, comparing Adobe's Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), Salesforce Marketing Cloud Intelligence (formerly Datorama), and Google Analytics.

                                <p>It's common to see different numbers for seemingly identical metrics (like 'Page Views' or 'Sessions') between platforms. This doesn't mean one is "wrong"; they simply measure things differently. Understanding this is key to building trust in your data.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">GA defines a session as a group of interactions with your website in a given time frame. It ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. If a user returns after 45 minutes, it's a new session.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">CJA is person-based, not session-based. It stitches every touchpoint to a user profile. It analyzes the entire journey over time, making individual sessions less important than the overall sequence of events. However, CJA can still measure page views and sessions.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">Salesforce Intelligence is an aggregator. It primarily pulls data directly from other platforms via API connectors. Therefore, a 'session' from Google Analytics reported in a Salesforce Intelligence dashboard is simply the same metric pulled from GA. Its strength is showing you metrics from many platforms side-by-side, not creating its own measurement methodology. In the event it's not showing numbers accurately, it may actually be an issue with your configuration that should be evaluated.</p>

                                    <h4 class="font-bold" style="color: #246F99;">Key Takeaway:</h4>
                                    <p class="mt-1" style="color: #246F99;">GA excels at analyzing what happens <em>within a single visit</em>. CJA is built to understand what a <em>person does across multiple visits and channels</em> over their lifecycle. Salesforce Intelligence is built to <em>display metrics from various sources</em> in one place. This core difference explains most metric discrepancies.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">YouTube (via Google Ads) can report on 'view-through conversions' (a user saw an ad but didn't click, and converted later) and click-through conversions.

                                    <p class="mt-2">CJA focuses on the user's stitched journey. It will track a user who clicks a YouTube ad, lands on your site, and then converts. It provides a much richer view of what the user did between the click and the conversion, but it typically cannot see 'view-through' conversions without advanced integrations. This often leads to CJA reporting fewer conversions than YouTube, but with more detail on the path taken.</p>

                                    <h4 class="font-bold" style="color: #246F99;">Key Takeaway:</h4>
                                    <p class="mt-1" style="color: #246F99;">YouTube reports on conversions within its own ecosystem (including view-throughs), while CJA tracks the detailed user path *after* a click, often resulting in fewer but more context-rich conversion numbers.</p>

                                <p>A core challenge in modern analytics is creating a single view of the customer. Your reporting tool must be able to connect data from various platforms, and this is handled in two primary ways:</p>

                                    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg border">
                                        <h3 class="headline font-bold text-gray-800">1. Direct Data Sources</h3>
                                        <p class="mt-2">Platforms like Salesforce Intelligence use built-in connectors (e.g., for LinkedIn Ads) to pull aggregate performance data. This is fast and ideal for high-level channel reporting. CJA can also ingest data this way, but its primary strength lies elsewhere.</p>

                                        <p class="mt-2">This is where CJA excels. To see the full journey, it "stitches" data together. Using a unique ID (from Marketo, CRM, etc.), it connects an ad click to a web visit to an email open, creating one continuous user journey. When unifying profiles requires more complex identity resolution than just an email address (e.g., combining email with a MPI, UUID, or other unique factors), it's best to leverage Adobe Experience Platform's (AEP) connected data layer with CJA.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-1" style="color: #246F99;">Salesforce Intelligence and CJA excel at pulling aggregated data via direct connectors, but only CJA can stitch together granular, user-level data from multiple sources to create a unified journey from anonymous to known, from known to returned, etc...</p>

                        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong> is still a great solution for web analysis. You may always want to have it directly handy depending on the metric you are measuring, but not required.</p>
                        <p><strong>Salesforce Marketing Cloud Intelligence</strong> is a great dashboarding solution, ideal for aggregating performance metrics from many different ad platforms and marketing cloud to show ROI and campaign effectiveness at a very high level. with little to no AI inferences within it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Customer Journey Analytics (CJA)</strong> is the only tool of the three truly built for deep, cross-channel journey analysis. If your primary goal is to understand how users interact with Marketo emails, paid ads, and your website <em>over time</em>, and to analyze complex paths and drop-offs between these touchpoints, CJA is the strongest choice to complement your MarTech stack.</p>
                        <p class="font-semibold text-gray-700">It's also important to note that while Salesforce Marketing Cloud Intelligence is a strong dashboarding tool, you can choose to walk away from it and use CJA holistically in its place for both high-level dashboards and deep journey analysis. However, we'd still recommend continuing to reference third-party platform UIs (like Google Analytics and LinkedIn Campaign Manager) for the most granular, platform-specific validation.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg font-semibold" style="color: #1CADFF;">For marketers aiming to understand the complete, cross-channel customer journey, CJA offers the most powerful and comprehensive solution. It directly addresses the core need to analyze the entire customer journey rather than just individual channel performance.</p>
