    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application structure is simplified to focus purely on the six sequential project Phases (0 through 5). The navigation only displays these phases, prioritizing the step-by-step execution path of the POC. The financial and partnership context is removed from the primary UI view. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core content for each phase (tasks, deliverables, goals) remains the primary view. The phased views continue to use Chart.js visualizations where appropriate to illustrate focus allocation or projected outcomes. All visuals adhere to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->

The 4 core stages are reflected below. As you go through each phase you will learn more of what each of our steps intail to get a flavor of how we partner together. As a reminder, each asset will have the ability to be experimented with (A/B testing and multivariant) allowing for vartiations of each email and sms.</p>
