    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A user-driven, dashboard-style SPA. The core interaction is a multi-platform selector that dynamically updates all modules on the page. This non-linear structure was chosen to empower users to create their own comparisons, which is far more efficient than reading a static report. The flow is: 1) Get a quick recommendation via the "Archetype Selector", or 2) Manually select platforms for a deep comparison. All subsequent content (profiles, radar chart, detailed text) is filtered and rendered based on this selection, transforming the report into an interactive decision-support tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Recommendation Matrix -> Dropdown + Highlighted Cards -> Goal: Quickest path to a relevant answer. 2) Platform Profiles -> Side-by-side columns -> Goal: High-level summary. 3) Master Feature Ratings -> Interactive Radar Chart (Chart.js) -> Goal: Powerful visual summary of relative strengths/weaknesses. This is the "wow" factor. 4) Detailed Narratives -> Dropdown-controlled text blocks -> Goal: Progressive disclosure of deep-dive information without cluttering the UI. All choices prioritize interactivity and user-driven exploration. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
